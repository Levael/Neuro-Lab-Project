BUGS:
1) delete heading direction throws exeption
2) no resize for window in fullscreen mode
3) mine, btw: 'savedDataMarker' 67 line

CHANGES TO DO:
1) change main window appearance
2) psycho graph - instead of range (-100, 100) make (=25, 25)
3) maybe change audio signals for correct/incorrec answers
4) debug win buttons form make in the same main form but not separate (two possible inputs: btns or keyboard (numpad))
5) remove (or at least comment) "stick on" option (related to trials)
6) instead of Rat name (in txt file with experiment data) optionally store student + test subject names. Make fields for this
7) display where experiment data is saved
8) immediately inform if MOOG not connected (start from a banal check for ethernet cable connection)

QUESTIONS:
1) where all recieved data is stored? And when is it saved?
